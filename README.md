Plenty of services love to use the emoji shortcodes in plain-text markup, so this library aims to simplify that process
for you, making üòé become `:sunglasses:`, üí° to `:bulb:`, etc. There's
[an amazing list of shortcodes here](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) if you want to explore them.

```js
var emoji = require('emoji-shorts');

console.log(emoji.toPlain('These violent delights have violent ends üòà'));
// These violent delights have violent ends :smiling_imp:

console.log(emoji.toRich('The most elegant parts of me weren\'t written by you :thinking:'));
// The most elegant parts of me weren't written by you ü§î
```

This module is built using [`lodash.toarray@4`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.toarray) and
[`github/gemoji`](https://github.com/github/gemoji) (a big üëè to both teams for their excellent work on those). The
latter has had some post-processing done to make lookups more efficient.
